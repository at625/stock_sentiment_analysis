# Stock Sentiment Analysis
This project analyzes the sentiment of stock-related tweets and correlates it with historical stock prices, aiming to predict market direction using machine learning. It includes a Flask web application for interactive exploration and a machine learning pipeline for price direction prediction.

# Features
- Sentiment Analysis: Uses NLTKâ€™s VADER to analyze tweet sentiment for each stock and date.
- Data Processing: Merges daily average sentiment scores with Yahoo Finance stock data.
- Feature Engineering: Computes rolling averages (SMA), lags, and direction labels for supervised learning.
- Machine Learning: Trains a Random Forest classifier to predict if the next day's close price will go up or down.
- Web App: Interactive dashboard to select stocks and view sentiment/price features.
